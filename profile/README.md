# NTU Astronomical Society (NTUAS)

Welcome to the official repository for the **NTU Astronomical Society (NTUAS)**. Founded in 1991, we are one of the most established special interest clubs at Nanyang Technological University, dedicated to making the wonders of the universe accessible to all.

## 🌌 About Us
The NTU Astronomical Society aims to be a vibrant community where students can explore the cosmos together. Whether you are a total beginner who just loves looking at the stars or an experienced amateur astronomer with your own gear, there is a place for you here.

Our mission is to make astronomy **fun, accessible, and exciting** for the entire NTU community.

## 🔭 What We Do

### 1. Stargazing Sessions & Events
We regularly host astronomy events to share and discuss the wonders of planets, stars, and deep-sky objects. These are typically followed by stargazing sessions where members can:
* Observe celestial objects through our telescopes.
* Practice and unleash their **astrophotography** skills.
* Learn to identify constellations and navigate the night sky.

### 2. Signature Annual Trip: *Stella Vista*
*Stella Vista* is our premier stargazing expedition. We travel to dark-sky locations away from Singapore's light pollution—past trips include **Bintan, Langkawi, and Tioman**. These trips offer:
* Unforgettable nights under clear, dark skies.
* Intensive telescope observation sessions.
* Cultural exploration and bonding with fellow astrophiles.

### 4. Collaborations & Outreach
We work with other NTU communities to raise awareness about astronomical issues.
* **Example:** Earth Hour collaboration with EarthLink to educate on light pollution and its environmental impacts.
